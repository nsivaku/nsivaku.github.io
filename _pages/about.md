<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Statistics at UNC Chapel Hill. I work in the [MURGe Lab](https://murgelab.cs.unc.edu/) where I am mentored by [Prof. Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/) and [Prof. Elias Stengel-Eskin](https://esteng.github.io/). **I am currently seeking PhD programs for Fall 2026.** 

My research focuses on building collaborative multimodal AI systems for monitorable LLM reasoning. Additionally, I am interested in using post-training methods for LLMs to improve interpretability.
